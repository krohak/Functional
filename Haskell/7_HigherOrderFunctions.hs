-- foldr function

-- Many functions that take a list as their argument can be defined using the
-- following simple pattern of recursion on lists:
-- f [] = v
-- f (x:xs) = x # f xs
-- That is, the function maps the empty list to a value v, and any non-empty list 
-- to an operator # applied to the head of the list and the result of recursively 
-- processing the tail.
sum1 [] = 0
sum1(x:xs) = x+sum1 xs
or1 [] = False
or1 (x:xs) = x || or1 xs
and1 [] = True
and1 (x:xs) = x && and1 xs

-- functions on lists, with the operator # and the value v as arguments
a sum2 = foldr (+) 0
or2 :: [Bool] -> Bool
or2 = foldr (||) False
and2 :: [Bool] -> Bool
and2 = foldr (&&) True

-- These new definitions could also include explicit list arguments, as in
sum3 xs = foldr (+) 0 xs
or3 xs = foldr (||) False xs


foldr2 f v [] = v
foldr2 f v (x:xs) = f x (foldr2 f v xs)

-- That is, the function foldr f v maps the empty list to the value v, and any 
-- non-empty list to the function f applied to the head of the list and the 
-- recursively processed tail. In practice, however, it is best to think of the 
-- behaviour of foldr f v in a non-recursive manner, as simply replacing each cons 
-- operator in a list by the function f, and the empty list at the end by the value v.
-- For example, applying the function foldr (+) 0 to the list
-- 1 : (2 : (3 : []))
-- gives the result
-- 1 + (2 + (3 + 0))

-- alculating the length of a list amounts to replacing each cons by the function that adds 
-- one to its second argument, and the empty list by zero.

-- he function sum can be redefined in this manner by using an auxiliary function sumâ€™ that takes

        sum' v (x:xs) = sum' (v+x) xs


-- many functions on lists can be defined using the following simple pattern of recursion:
-- f v [] = v
-- f v (x:xs) = f (v # x) xs


-- That is, the function maps the empty list to the accumulator value v, and any non-empty list to the 
-- result of recursively processing the tail using a new accu- mulator value obtained by applying an operator 
-- # to the current value and the head of the list

-- 2. Without looking at the definitions from the standard prelude, define the following higher-order library functions on lists.
-- a. Decide if all elements of a list satisfy a predicate:
-- all2 :: (a -> Bool) -> [Bool] -> Bool
all2 f = foldr (\x xs -> f x && xs) True
all3 p = and . map p

-- b. Decide if any element of a list satisfies a predicate:
-- any :: (a -> Bool) -> [Bool] -> Bool
any2 f = foldr (\x xs -> f x || xs) False
any3 p = or . map p

-- c. Select elements from a list while they satisfy a predicate:
-- takeWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

takeWhile1 f [] = []
takeWhile1 f (x:xs)
    | f x = x: takeWhile1 f xs
    | otherwise = []

-- d. Remove elements from a list while they satisfy a predicate:
-- dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
dropWhile1 f [] = []
dropWhile1 f (x:xs)
    | f x = dropWhile1 f xs
    | otherwise = x:xs

-- Note: in the prelude the first two of these functions are generic functions rather than being specific to the type of lists.

-- 5. Without looking at the definitions from the standard prelude, define the higher-order library function curry that converts a function 
-- on pairs into a curried function, and, conversely, the function uncurry that converts a curried function with two arguments into a function on pairs.

-- curry1 :: ((a0, b0) -> c0) -> a0 -> b0 -> c0
-- \x.\y = x+y
-- \ x y = x+y

curry1 :: ((a0, b0) -> c0) -> a0 -> b0 -> c0

-- A higher-order function unfold that encapsulates a simple pattern of recursion for producing a list can be defined as follows:
unfold p h t x 
    | p x = []
    | otherwise = h x : unfold p h t (t x)
-- That is, the function unfold p h t produces the empty list if the predicate p is true of the argument value, and otherwise produces a non-empty list by applying 
-- the function h to this value to give the head, and the function t to generate another argument that is recursively processed in the same way to produce the tail 
-- of the list. For example, the function int2bin can be rewritten more compactly using unfold as follows:
int2bin1 = unfold (== 0) (`mod` 2) (`div` 2)
-- Redefine the functions chop8, map f and iterate f using unfold.
chop8two = unfold null (take 8) (drop 8)
map4 f = unfold null (f . head) tail
iterate2 f = unfold null f f


-- Modify the binary string transmitter example to detect simple transmission errors using the concept of parity bits. That is, each eight-bit binary number produced during 
-- encoding is extended with a parity bit, set to one if the number contains an odd number of ones, and to zero otherwise. In turn, each resulting nine-bit binary number 
-- consumed during decoding is checked to ensure that its parity bit is correct, with the parity bit being discarded if this is the case, and a parity error being reported 
-- otherwise. Hint: the library function error :: String -> a displays the given string as an error message and terminates the program; the polymorphic result type ensures 
-- that error can be used in any context.
