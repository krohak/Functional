-- foldr function

-- Many functions that take a list as their argument can be defined using the
-- following simple pattern of recursion on lists:
-- f [] = v
-- f (x:xs) = x # f xs
-- That is, the function maps the empty list to a value v, and any non-empty list 
-- to an operator # applied to the head of the list and the result of recursively 
-- processing the tail.

sum1(x:xs) = x+sum1 xs
or1 [] = False
or1 (x:xs) = x || or1 xs
and1 [] = True
and1 (x:xs) = x && and1 xs

-- foldr (abbreviating fold right) encapsulates this pattern of recursion for defining 
-- functions on lists, with the operator # and the value v as arguments
a sum2 = foldr (+) 0
or2 :: [Bool] -> Bool
or2 = foldr (||) False
and2 :: [Bool] -> Bool

-- These new definitions could also include explicit list arguments, as in
sum3 xs = foldr (+) 0 xs
or3 xs = foldr (||) False xs


foldr2 f v [] = v
foldr2 f v (x:xs) = f x (foldr2 f v xs)

-- That is, the function foldr f v maps the empty list to the value v, and any 
-- non-empty list to the function f applied to the head of the list and the 
-- recursively processed tail. In practice, however, it is best to think of the 
-- behaviour of foldr f v in a non-recursive manner, as simply replacing each cons 
-- operator in a list by the function f, and the empty list at the end by the value v.
-- For example, applying the function foldr (+) 0 to the list
-- 1 : (2 : (3 : []))
-- gives the result
-- 1 + (2 + (3 + 0))

-- alculating the length of a list amounts to replacing each cons by the function that adds 
-- one to its second argument, and the empty list by zero.

-- foldl

-- he function sum can be redefined in this manner by using an auxiliary function sumâ€™ that takes 
-- an extra argument v that is used to accumulate the final result:
sum4 = sum' 0
    where
        sum' v [] = v
        sum' v (x:xs) = sum' (v+x) xs


-- many functions on lists can be defined using the following simple pattern of recursion:
-- f v [] = v
-- f v (x:xs) = f (v # x) xs


-- That is, the function maps the empty list to the accumulator value v, and any non-empty list to the 
-- result of recursively processing the tail using a new accu- mulator value obtained by applying an operator 
-- # to the current value and the head of the list
